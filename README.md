Purpose of the tool: Prevent Error Level Analysis from returning useful data when analyzing a given image. 

Current Status: Only script written so far can return the Luminance or "Y" level of an image, showing brightness. The ability to edit pixels on this Y Level has also been added. 

Next Steps: Detail how ELA is performed from looking at the Y level. Add ELA functionality to the tool. Begin to discuss how ELA can be fuzzed away without attacking the integrity of the original picture.
